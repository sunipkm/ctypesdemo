# Example of calling C functions from Python
This is an example library developed to demonstrate how C functions can be called from Python, and how to pass array pointers to said C function. The program can be built and run by executing `make` in the root directory. `make clean` will revert directory state to the initial state.

The `Makefile` that is included also provides a good example of how interdependencies work in `make`.

Happy learning!
